		  <strong>Boot heuristic algorithm </strong>is the strategies derived from previous experiences with similar problems.It gives <strong>trading decision by making base of Trial and Error</strong>, rule of thumb,educated guess,an intuitive judgment, common sense.
		  Boot heuristic is a problem solving technique, often called simply <strong>"find" or "discover")</strong> is any approach to problem solving, learning, or discovery that
		   employs a practical method, <strong>not guaranteed to be perfect, logical, or rational, but instead sufficient for reaching an immediate goal.</strong>Where finding an optimal solution is <strong>almost impossible or impractical,</strong> heuristic methods can be used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution. Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision.So here Boot Heuristic Algorithm work for you.
